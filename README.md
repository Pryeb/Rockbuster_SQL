# Rockbuster Stealth  
Working on Rockbuster Stealth LLC's data ,I conducted in-depth analysis using SQL to address various department queries, and presented insightful visualizations using Tableau, offering a comprehensive overview for strategic decision-making in the launch of their online video rental service. 

# Key Questions :  
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?  
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?  
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?  
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?  

# Final Analysis Criteria  
● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.  
● Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling
a compelling story.  
● Present your SQL results to your technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a
data dictionary.  
● Create a professional project that you can add to your portfolio and show to
employers.
